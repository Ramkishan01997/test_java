Your Awesome Selenium Project
A brief, one-paragraph description of what this project does. For example, "This is an automated testing suite for the 'Sauce Demo' e-commerce website, written in Python with the Selenium WebDriver library. It includes tests for user login, product selection, and checkout functionality."

üìã Prerequisites
Before you can run these tests, you need to have the following software installed on your machine:

Python 3.x: Ensure Python is installed and added to your system's PATH. You can download it from python.org.

pip: The Python package installer, which usually comes with Python.

Google Chrome / ChromeDriver: These tests are configured to run on Google Chrome. You must have the Chrome browser installed. You also need the appropriate version of the ChromeDriver executable. You can download it from the official ChromeDriver website.

üöÄ Installation
Follow these steps to get your project up and running locally.

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-project-name>.git
cd <your-project-name>

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
Place the WebDriver:
Place the downloaded chromedriver executable file in a location that is accessible by your system's PATH. Alternatively, you can specify the path to the driver directly in your code.

Update environment variables (optional):
If your tests require specific usernames, passwords, or URLs, create a .env file in the project's root directory and add them like this:

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Tests
To execute the entire test suite, simply run the following command from the project's root directory:

# Example using pytest
pytest

# or a specific test file
pytest tests/test_login.py

You can add other flags and options to pytest as needed, such as -s to see print() output or --headless to run tests without a browser UI.
